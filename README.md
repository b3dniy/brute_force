# Password Cracker

## Overview

This project is a Python-based password cracking tool designed to brute-force passwords from a given list. The tool utilizes different cracking methods to attempt and identify passwords stored in a list.

## Files

- `passwords.txt`: A text file containing a list of hashed passwords.
- `stubs.py`: Contains placeholder functions and classes used throughout the project.
- `password_cracker.py`: The main script that handles the password cracking logic.
- `bf.py`: An auxiliary script that implements brute force methods.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (if any, mention them here)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-cracker.git
cd password-cracker
```

2. Install any required dependencies (if applicable):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Password Cracker

1. Ensure `passwords.txt` is in the same directory as `password_cracker.py`.

2. Run the password cracking script:

```bash
python password_cracker.py
```

This will start the password cracking process using the passwords listed in `passwords.txt`.

## Details

### passwords.txt

This file contains a list of hashed passwords that the tool will attempt to crack.

### stubs.py

This file includes stub functions and classes that are placeholders for the actual implementations. It helps in maintaining the structure and design of the code.

### password_cracker.py

This is the main script responsible for orchestrating the password cracking process. It reads the passwords from `passwords.txt` and applies various cracking techniques defined in `bf.py`.

### bf.py

This script implements the brute force algorithms used by `password_cracker.py`. It includes the logic required to systematically attempt all possible combinations to find the matching passwords.
